This idea has been the status quo in tech as long as I've been in it (since 2011) and I'm just now beginning to think it may not be the obvious best choice for everyone, including me. It's hard to quantify the pros & cons; do I really benefit enough from overhearing project conversations to offset the distractions that necessarily accompany the setup?

## Pros
- Overhearing related conversations about tasks
	- Primary tasks might collide, knowing that by passive eavesdropping it useful (_"Oh we're both changing Foo??"_)
	- Nonprimary tasks might impact a coworker, good to become aware of (_"Hey I'm gonna change component Bar to `flexbox`"_)
- Ease of collaboration
	- Information sharing (_"hey hear about this new tool?"_)
	- Accidental pairing (a good thing!)
	- Ask advice (put people in different rooms and see how often they seek each other out for input)
- Team culture building
	- Naturally Occuring Norms
	- Building rapport with each other makes it easier to discuss tech decisions every day

## Cons
- Distractions...

## So...
Thinking about an open workspace starts the conversation about what kind of team culture you have or what kind you want to have. Teams that self-select might already have good rapport, openness to communicate, and an understanding of each other's personal space both physically and socially. Self-selected teams might know how to work in an open workspace effectively from day one. 

However, most teams are not self-selected but are individuals placed together by some other person's or group's decision. In these situations it's good practice to;
- Establish team norms around respectful teamspace behavior
	- Noise levels
	- Core hours
- Build team culture together
	- Outings
	- Non-work related lightning talks
- Provide an additional space/room where team members could focus-down and escape a bit, but not employ it perpetually

My bottom line is - it's dependent on your team maturity and definitely NOT the automagic decision. I think that most teams can be productive and respectful and if you have individuals that can't keep distractions at home then maybe they aren't a cultural fit? If you have team members who aren't used to the open workspace then having availability of workspaces with a bit of seclusion (hopefully they're pairing) or having a bit stricter norms around loudness can make the switch less disagreeable. 

## For me
I do think that an open workspace, with respectful understandings in place, is a better setup that provides many opportunities for info share and collaboration that make team uplift so much easier to achieve. The way you achieve that goal depends on your team members. Being able to take a group, see the personalities you have, and adjust so that everybody can work and thrive in an open workspace should be an early concern on any new team. And as members join a team it should be a prority to both accommodate them and adapt them to continue what success you may have had before they arrived.
