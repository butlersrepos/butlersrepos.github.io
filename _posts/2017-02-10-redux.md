### Supplemental

If you wanna follow allow with some code that I reference later:  <a href="https://github.com/butlersrepos/reduxtris">reduxtris</a>.

## What's Redux?

If you haven't read anything yet <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux">Redux</a> is a simplistic state container for centrally managing a webapp's state. I highly recommend checking out their github and documentation since they do a really astute job of demonstrating its usage and even best practices in a pretty succinct way.

## My initial excitement

<img src="http://media.riffsy.com/images/19530af3598aa7bbbd9b84975ca9f353/tenor.gif">

I'm probably overblowing this but I might just be in some Redux-induced honeymoon period. I've begun to see every webapp issue of state as an opportunity to `npm i redux` and just start `dispatch`ing and `subscribe`ing. And so far I don't see any problem with it. I actually hope this cloud of euphoric state management meets a wall of over-application-realization so that I can feel like I know when NOT to use Redux... but I really hope that wall is somewhere far from here.

## The great parts

Using `redux` along with a library like `reselect` feels concise and straight forward. I've implemented filtering and sorting of large lists and watched the automagic memoization of `reselect` perform like a champ. I've gotten very comfortable writing reducers for `redux` stores and unit-testing them in no time. BTW, If you wanna test-drive in a sleek new vehicle of a test-runner check out <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/">Jest</a>. The devtools for `redux` tat allow time-travel debugging are more than sufficient to feel like you have x-ray vision on your webapp but I've found that I rarely ever need to do it since testing the operations to and from the `redux` store are so tiny in each of themselves.
Passing a reference to the store around depends on your library/stack of choice but lately I've just kept to a global reference to it for the most part. Everything has been a joy to work with basically.

## And then I tried to build Tetris...

<img src="http://www.brain-magazine.fr/m/posts/32473/originals/tetris.gif">

Reduxtris. Managing state in a webapp is a vastly different world than managing state in a game.  The first challenge that presented itself was how to initiate and maintain the primary game loop. Virtually every game has a loop that normally consists of updating logic and rendering logic. I had a few concerns:

1. Our tick has to speed up based on what level you're at
2. Something has to "start" the game
3. I want to be able to pause the game, i.e. pause the ticking
4. Having the Redux store listen for TICKs is one thing, but I can't have the store `dispatch` too

Answers:

1. The tick time could be a piece of derived state based on lines completed.
2. My conclusion was to tie the ticking to the UI component that would become the start button.
3. The store keeps the game state and simply skips any updating, the ticks keep going though.
4. Solved by 2. The start button continues to set timeouts to continue TICKing.

My entire `riot`-based start button looks like this (please ignore my combination of ES6 import and `requires`)
{% highlight javascript %}

let Actions = require('../state-stuff/actions');
let PieceBag = require('../game-logic/piece-bag');
let GameStates = require('../game-logic/game-states');
import { tickInterval } from '../state-stuff/selectors';

<start-menu onclick={ start }>
    <button>WAN 2 PLAE?!</button>

    <script>
        this.start = () => {
            Store.dispatch(Actions.startGame())
            this.tickIt();
        }

        tickIt() {
            setTimeout(() => {
                if( Store.getState().gameState == GameStates.PLAYING ) {
                    Store.dispatch(Actions.tickGame())
                }
                this.tickIt()
            }, tickInterval(Store.getState()));
        }
    </script>
    
    <style scoped=scoped>
        :scope {
            position: absolute;
            width: 320px;
            height: 240px;
            top: 120px;
            left: 160px;
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
        }
    </style>
</start-menu>
{% endhighlight %}

## Why would you do this?

I really wanted to create a sort of self contained Tetris-in-a-box, that box being a `redux` store, so that I could use the same core and wrap vastly different render layers on top later by just ensuring they understood how to render a game's state from a JSON object. This idea and pattern fits really well into libraries like `react`, `vue.js`, `riot`, and `inferno` (there are plenty of others). For this effort I was starting out with `riot` which is my current jam. My hope (as of this writing) is to one day add a pure `react` renderer and then a `PIXI.js` one in 2D and maaaaybe 3D but that's a bigger effort.

## What about immutability?

Luckily for this game that state isn't that large and so each of my entities that provide any "mutation" sounding methods actually returns a new instance. For example my `piece` objects, which represent the current tetromino and the upcoming one too, have methods such as `rotate`, `fall`, `left`, and `right`;

{% highlight javascript %}
return {
        origin() { return { row: config.row, col: config.col }; },
        type() { return config.type; },
        fall() {
            return create({
                ...config,
                row: config.row + 1
            });
        },
        rotate() {
            return create({
                ...config,
                rotation: config.rotation + (config.type == 'O' ? 0 : 90)
            });
        },
	...
{% endhighlight %}

each of these returns a newly created `piece` which embodies the result of the method invoked. The entire game grid is also reproduced each TICK and updated with the location of the new `piece`. In this way the store maintains the immutability that is central to `redux`.

## I ran your game, it looks `BASIC`

I'm not a designer!

I stuck to a very simple CSS and `riot` component setup to focus on the `redux` portion for now but I will say that those components are amazingly simple to write once you cruise into the `getState()` and `dispatch` pattern of `redux`. It was a relative breeze to 

- create a new element
- check some state
- render some stuff
- allow an event or two that dispatch an update

The amount of time I put into this project was surprisingly light and felt light while doing it thanks to the clean separation of state and declarative elements.

## Did you test this?

At first no...

<img src="http://media.riffsy.com/images/65866ba370141523c412fb6c0dd2de6d/tenor.gif" />

I was largely focused on how this idea would play out, so I wrote a lot of <a href="http://agiledictionary.com/209/spike">spike code</a> that just became my functioning app :( . Later on I decided that some tests would be nice and I took the chance to bring in <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest">Jest</a> and learn that a little bit...

## Jest

`Jest` is amazing for unit testing. I had to get used to some conventions but the commandline interface and the speed were great. I was even able to find a `riot` plugin, in short order, to be able to unit test my components much to my surprise (check my `package.json`'s "jest" property for the setup). Test runners like this need to be more prevalent since they help bring non-testers on board once they see how fast and easy it is to red-green-refactor.

I did have some difficulty with `Jest`'s supposed auto-mocking while testing the <a href="https://github.com/butlersrepos/reduxtris/blob/master/tests/game-loop.test.js">game loop</a>. `Jest` claims to have an auto-mocking feature enabled by default but I couldn't quite see that happening. My initial tests for my GameLoop module was failing on a collaborator's implementation... which suggests it was **not** mocked. So in the end I had to place the `jest.mock` calls before my test suite declaration in order to provide some safe stubs. But aside from that snafu the test runner is a breath of fresh air and I would recommend people to get a familiarity with it ASAP.

## Where is this thing?

I have the game hosted on my personal website <a href="http://ericbutler.info/#experiments">here</a>. While I was making this I also dabbled in **the devops** and setup a Travis CI job to deploy this project's `bundle.js` and audio files to an S3 bucket. So the files you pull each time you visit that website can be updated within minutes of me doing a `git push`. Cool... also sorry if it breaks :\|

## What have you learned?

I would definitely **not** recommend `redux` for complex game engines.

I would still recommend it for most webapps.

`Riot` continues to be fun to write and if it weren't for my desire to build confidence with `React` I would just stick with `riot`.

`Jest` is hawt.

The logic to rotate a piece in Tetris either went WAY over my head or is the most significant puzzle in the game.

Travis and S3 deployments make me feel all dev-opsy.
